# Continuous Integration and Releases

## Supported Versions

The primary development and live-test runtime is Node.js 22.22.0. Static CI
also tests Node.js 24.19.0. Odd-numbered Node.js releases, including Node.js
23, are not supported targets.

Run `nvm use` from the repository root to select the version in `.nvmrc`. If
`nvm current` reports `system`, nvm has not selected the repository version.

The integration harness reads the exact n8n and `@n8n/cli` versions from
`.n8n-version` and `.n8n-cli-version`.

## Documentation Distribution

This runbook, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and `AGENTS.md` are repository-maintainer
documents. They are intentionally excluded from the npm package by the
`package.json` `files` allowlist. Do not add them to the published tarball.

The root `README.md` is included automatically by npm and is the package-user
document shown on the npm registry. Links from that README to maintainer
documents must use absolute GitHub URLs so they remain valid after packaging.
Put installation, authentication, operation, and support guidance needed by
package users in the README; keep CI credentials and release administration in
this repository-only runbook.

## CI Triggers and Trust Policy

The CI workflow runs static checks on:

- Every pull request
- Every push to `develop`
- Every manual workflow dispatch

Static checks run lint, build, and Vitest on Node.js 22.22.0 and 24.19.0.

Every GitHub Action is pinned to a full commit SHA, with its release tag kept in
an inline comment for readability. Dependabot checks action updates monthly;
review the upstream release and resolved commit before merging an update.

Live pdfRest checks run after static checks on:

- Pull requests whose source branch is in this repository, except Dependabot
- Pushes to `develop`
- Manual workflow dispatches

Public fork and Dependabot pull requests receive static checks only and do not
receive the pdfRest credential. Their workflow summary explains why the live job
was not eligible. Maintainers review accepted changes before applying them
through an upstream branch. Do not change this workflow to `pull_request_target`.

This is a trust boundary, not just a GitHub limitation. A pull request can
change node code, tests, package scripts, dependencies, workflow definitions,
and integration scripts. Any of that code can read and disclose a credential
once the credential is present on its runner. Fork code is therefore never run
with the pdfRest credential. The `pdfrest-live` environment provides a second
gate for same-repository branches: its reviewer approves the exact commit
before GitHub releases the environment secret.

Changing a pull request's base branch does not change where its head branch is
hosted. A fork pull request remains ineligible for live tests even when it
targets a temporary branch in this repository. Public repositories cannot
prevent people from forking or proposing pull requests, so this policy treats
those requests as untrusted and keeps the credential boundary intact. Public
visibility does not grant permission to create or push branches in this
repository; only repository collaborators with write access can do that.

## Maintainer Development Flow

Use this single-pull-request flow for work by authorized maintainers:

1. Work locally in a personal fork if desired. A maintainer may push work in
   progress to that fork, but does not open a fork pull request for the normal
   maintainer workflow.
2. When the change is ready for review, push the local commit directly to a
   temporary branch in this repository. For example:

   ```bash
   git push upstream HEAD:refs/heads/pdfcloud-6122-n8n-node
   ```

   Use a lowercase, kebab-case `<jira-key>-<summary>` name for every temporary
   branch. Omit the Jira key when there is none.
3. Open one pull request from the temporary same-repository branch to
   `develop`. The CI workflow starts automatically. After static checks pass,
   the live job waits for the `pdfrest-live` environment reviewer.
4. The independent reviewer verifies the exact head commit, then approves or
   rejects the live job. Merge to `develop`
   only after the live test passes.
5. Delete the temporary branch after merge.

External changes are reviewed without secrets. For an accepted change, a
maintainer reimplements or selectively applies the reviewed work through the
maintainer flow above. This keeps the only code that can request live-test
approval on a branch controlled by repository collaborators.

Temporary feature branches normally do not need branch protection. Access to
create or update them is already limited to repository collaborators, and the
`pdfrest-live` environment approval is the credential gate. Protect long-lived
branches such as `develop` and any release branch. Review the exact head commit
again before approving a live job because a later push creates new code that
could access the credential.

## GitHub Configuration

Create a GitHub environment named `pdfrest-live` with this secret:

- `PDFREST_API_KEY`: API key for the dedicated pdfRest CI account

Protect `pdfrest-live` with required reviewers, enable **Prevent self-review**,
and disable administrator bypass. Before approving a live job, review the exact
commit for changes to GitHub Actions workflows, integration scripts, package
scripts and lockfiles, node code, and n8n workflow definitions. The job cannot
start or receive the environment secret until an independent reviewer approves
it.

The account should have enough quota for both all-endpoint workflows on every
same-repository pull request, `develop` push, manual run, and release.
Monitor usage in pdfRest and rotate the key through the GitHub environment
rather than changing repository files.

The environment accepts these optional variables:

- `PDFREST_BASE_URL`: pdfRest API base URL; defaults to
  `https://api.pdfrest.com`
- `PDFREST_TEST_PDF_URL`: URL-upload fixture for the general PDF
- `PDFREST_TEST_REDACTION_PDF_URL`: URL-upload fixture for the redaction PDF
- `PDFREST_TEST_IMAGE_URL`: URL-upload fixture for the image

The committed public URLs remain the defaults until controlled URL hosting is
introduced. Changing a variable replaces only the corresponding known URL in
the temporary workflow copy.

## Live-Test Bootstrap

CI installs the pinned n8n and `@n8n/cli` toolchain in a separate step before
the `pdfrest-live` environment credential is injected. The credential-bearing
step receives that preinstalled toolchain and invokes
`scripts/integration/run-live-tests.sh` directly, so the CI path does not run
package installation or package-manager lifecycle hooks with the credential.
The local `npm run test:integration:live` command installs the same pinned tools
when no preinstalled tools directory is configured, with `PDFREST_API_KEY`
removed from the installer environment.

The live harness builds all n8n state from scratch on each run:

1. Use the pinned n8n and `@n8n/cli` versions from a temporary directory.
2. Start n8n on localhost with an isolated SQLite database, encryption key,
   and environment-managed owner.
3. Authenticate the owner, create a short-lived n8n API key, and create the
   `pdfRestApi` credential through `@n8n/cli`.
4. Copy the committed fixtures and generate a one-day signing certificate,
   PFX file, and random password in the temporary copy.
5. Render temporary workflows with the new credential ID, absolute fixture
   path, configured URL fixtures, and debug request diagnostics enabled.
6. Create both workflows with `@n8n/cli --file`, stop the server, and execute
   each workflow with `n8n execute --id`.
7. Delete the database, credentials, API key, rendered workflows, and generated
   signing material through the cleanup trap.

Credential IDs in committed workflow exports are n8n instance-specific. They
are never expected to match CI. The renderer replaces every `pdfRestApi`
credential reference structurally in a temporary copy and fails if the
workflow schema, file paths, or URLs are unexpected.

Every live job writes a Markdown result to the GitHub Actions job summary. It
lists both workflows, their completion status, and an allowlisted diagnostic
record for each extracted failure: node, item index, HTTP status, safe error
classification, and value-free field metadata. Free-form error messages,
response bodies, request context, and causes are excluded because they may
contain authenticated headers or customer-controlled values.

Request diagnostics are disabled during ordinary node execution. The renderer
enables them only in the temporary CI workflow copies, where n8n's debug logger
emits a value-free manifest for correlation by node name and item index. The
manifest uses the fixed operation identifier instead of the request URL and may
describe body, query, header, and binary fields by type, MIME type, and byte
count. It never includes field values, filenames, file contents, passphrases,
resource IDs, asynchronous request IDs, URLs, or credential values.

Raw n8n server, CLI, and workflow execution logs remain in the runner's
temporary diagnostics directory. The harness never prints raw execution output
to the Actions log. The summary step parses the raw files locally, writes a
separate sanitized `diagnostics.json`, and both CI workflows upload that file by
its exact path for five days on failure. Each artifact error record contains
only node, item index, HTTP status, safe classification, and value-free field
metadata. The workflows never upload the raw diagnostics directory.
Secret-bearing bootstrap files remain outside both diagnostics locations and
are deleted before the job exits.

The harness does not automatically retry pdfRest operation failures. Many
operations consume quota or are not safely idempotent, so three blanket retries
could multiply cost or side effects. Local owner/API-key requests have a
15-second timeout, n8n readiness has a 60-second deadline, and the GitHub live
job has a 45-minute timeout. The current asynchronous OCR branch verifies that
the start and status endpoints accept requests; it does not poll until OCR
completion.

To run the same harness locally:

```bash
nvm use
npm ci
npm run build
PDFREST_API_KEY='<dedicated-test-key>' npm run test:integration:live
```

Optional environment variables use the same names as the GitHub variables.
Never commit a key, generated PFX file, or generated password.

## Stable Releases

Publishing has one trigger: pushing a stable `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` tag. The
workflow rejects prerelease tags and rejects a tag whose version does not match
`package.json` exactly. Release tags repeat the static and live gates before
publishing.

Create a GitHub environment named `npm-production`. A required reviewer is
recommended.

Configure npm trusted publishing for:

- GitHub organization or user: the owner of this repository
- Repository: `n8n-nodes-pdfrest`
- Workflow filename: `publish.yml`
- Environment: `npm-production`
- Allowed action: `npm publish`

The publish job uses a GitHub-hosted runner, npm 11.19.0, and `id-token: write`
to authenticate exclusively through OIDC trusted publishing. Do not configure
an npm publishing token or OTP in GitHub. The n8n node CLI publishes with
provenance and the public access configured in `package.json`.

After the publish command succeeds, the job allows up to 20 minutes for npm's
publish-time scan to make the version visible in the registry. The publish job
has a 35-minute deadline so the pinned n8n community package scanner can then
check that exact version. The job explicitly fails unless the scanner reports
success.

Before creating a release tag, both parts of the release ownership gate must be
confirmed:

- The npm organization owner has granted the designated release maintainer the
  required organization access and configured the npm trusted publisher.
- The designated release maintainer has configured and tested the GitHub
  Actions publishing automation.

Missing npm ownership, trusted-publisher configuration, GitHub environment
permissions, or provenance is a release blocker. Do not add a token fallback or
publish from a developer machine.

Prepare a version change through the normal pull-request process. After it is
merged and all CI checks pass, tag that exact commit and push the tag:

```bash
git tag v0.2.0
git push origin v0.2.0
```

Before the release candidate is declared ready for n8n verification, also run
the required scan against the package available in npm:

```bash
npx @n8n/scan-community-package @pdfrest/n8n-nodes-pdfrest
```

## Versioning Policy

Use semantic versions and keep feature or fix pull requests independent of the
package version. Select the release contents first, then create a dedicated
`release/<major>.<minor>.<patch>` branch and pull request that updates both
`package.json` and `package-lock.json`.

The intended first public release is `0.1.0`. Before `1.0.0`:

- Increment the patch version for backward-compatible fixes and documentation
  corrections that affect the package.
- Increment the minor version for backward-compatible operations or features.
- Increment the minor version for breaking changes, and call them out clearly
  in release notes. The `0.x` line does not promise a stable public API.

At and after `1.0.0`, increment patch for backward-compatible fixes, minor for
backward-compatible functionality, and major for breaking changes. Published
npm versions are immutable; never reuse a version. The stable release tag must
be exactly `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` and must match `package.json`.

The current publish workflow accepts stable tags only. Do not publish alpha,
beta, or release-candidate versions unless a separately reviewed change adds a
documented prerelease workflow and npm dist-tag policy.
